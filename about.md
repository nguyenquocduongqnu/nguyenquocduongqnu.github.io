My name is Jonathan Hui. I started this blog to share my excitement about Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Many articles here served as my personal notes. I wish that some of them give you better insights beyond the equations and give you enough details to explore.

Here is my favorite quote on intelligence and learning:

> Instead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child’s? If this were then subjected to an appropriate course of education one would obtain the adult brain. Presumably the child brain is something like a notebook as one buys it from the stationer’s. Rather little mechanism, and lots of blank sheets. (Mechanism and writing are from our point of view almost synonymous.) Our hope is that there is so little mechanism in the child brain that something like it can be easily programmed. The amount of work in the education we can assume, as a first approximation, to be much the same as for the human child. By Alan Turing.

I also maintain a second blog in medium.com/@jonathan_hui. You can find more articles in object detection, GAN, self-driving and Reinforcement Learning. Hope you will enjoy them. For those interested in connecting with me professionally, you can find me on Linkedin.
