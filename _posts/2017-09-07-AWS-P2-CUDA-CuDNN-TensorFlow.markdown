> This article was written in 2017 which some information need to be updated by now. In particular the Amazon AMI instance is free now. Nevertheless, sometimes building a AMI for your software platform is needed and therefore I will leave this article AS IS.

We deploy our TensorFlow applications to the AWS EC2 with Nvidia GPU(s). In the first half, we use an Amazon Deep Learning AMI. In the second half, we build a TensorFlow platform from scratch using Ubuntu.

### EC2 P2 spot instance with Deep Learning AMI 
Amazon EC2 instances with GPU are expensive. Therefore, we pick the spot instances to reduce the cost. Nevertheless, spot instances can be terminated when your maximum bidding price falls below the current price. To mitigate that, we can create and attach another EBS volume to the instance. This additional volume stores training data, results and checkpoints. When an instance is terminated, we create a new instance and re-attach the EBS volume to the new instance. The training can later be resumed from the checkpoints.

> Different AWS regions have different pricing. Usually N. Virginia, Ohio, Oregon have cheaper price. Terminate the instance when it is not needed.

The cheapest instance with a GPU is **p2.xlarge**. For a p2.xlarge instance in 2017, the lowest AMI charge is $0.9/hour while the lowest spot instance charge is $0.2/hour.

#### p2.xlarge and Deep Learning AMI

In the AWS console, we create a new p2.xlarge spot instance.

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/tensorflow/s1.png" style="border:none;width:120%">
</div>

Then locate the Deep learning AMI.

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/tensorflow/s2.png" style="border:none;width:80%">
</div>

#### Network setting

We keep the default for the network.

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/tensorflow/s3.png" style="border:none;width:100%">
</div>

> Different regions may have different network configurations.

#### Storage

In the next page, we keep the setting in the storage and instance details. A 50 GiB EBS volume is created.

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/tensorflow/s4.png" style="border:none;width:120%">
</div>

> We can attach another EBS volume to store permanent data later.

#### Keypair and security

We configure a key and a security group for the new instance:
<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/tensorflow/s5.png" style="border:none;width:120%">
</div>

Create a new key pair:

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/tensorflow/key.png" style="border:none;width:80%">
</div>

Create a security group:

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/tensorflow/s6.png" style="border:none;width:80%">
</div>

#### Review

The final configuration should look similar to:

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/tensorflow/s7.png" style="border:none;width:80%">
</div>

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/tensorflow/s8.png" style="border:none;width:80%">
</div>

#### ssh access

We copy our private key _tf.pem_ into the home directory of our local machine and configure the ssh to access the spot instance.

```sh
cd ~/.ssh
mv ../tf.pem .    # Change the location of ../tf.pem accordingly
chmod og-r tf.pem
```

Edit the ssh configuration
```sh
vi config
```
 
Replace the hostname with your public IP address of the spot instance:
 
```
Host tf
    Hostname xx.xx.xx.xx
    Port 22
    User ec2-user
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/tf.pem
```

To access the spot instance:
```
ssh tf
```

### Testing

We should see K80 as the GPU when we run nvidia-smi on the spot instance.
```sh
$ nvidia-smi

### Build a Ubuntu TensorFlow

Instead of creating an EC2 instance from a Deep Learning AMI, this section creates an EC2 P2 instance from an Ubuntu AMI.

The Ubuntu AMI id can be located [here](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/) by searching "64 us ebs 16.04 HVM" for the US region. 

| US East (Ohio) |	us-east-2 |
| US East (N. Virginia) | us-east-1	|
| US West (N. California) | us-west-1 |
| US West (Oregon) | us-west-2 |

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/tensorflow/ss1.png" style="border:none;width:80%">
</div>

Spot instance information:
<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/tensorflow/sss1.png" style="border:none;width:80%">
</div>

Also increase the SSD storage size
<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/tensorflow/ssi.png" style="border:none;width:100%">
</div>

Since this is Ubuntu, we need to change the user from ec2-user to ubuntu in the ssh configuration.
```
Host tf
    Hostname xx.xx.xx.xx
    Port 22
    User ubuntu
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/tf.pem
```	

After creating the instance, we ssh'ed into the system and verify we have a Nvidia GPU.
```sh
ssh tf
```

```
$ lspci | grep -i nvidia
00:1e.0 3D controller: NVIDIA Corporation GK210GL [Tesla K80] (rev a1)
```

#### Install & upgrade pre-requisite package

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get --assume-yes upgrade
sudo apt-get --assume-yes install build-essential
```

#### CUDA 8

> To install a new version of TensorFlow,  we need to verify [the version of CUDA and CuDNN](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#nvidia_requirements_to_run_tensorflow_with_gpu_support) that it supports. Go to the Nvidia developer web site to locate the new download if it is different from below.

Install CUDA 8.0
```sh
wget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1604/x86_64/cuda-repo-ubuntu1604_8.0.61-1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1604_8.0.61-1_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cuda
```

Add CUDA to PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
cat >> ~/.bashrc << 'EOF'
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64\
${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
EOF
source ~/.bashrc
```

Verify CUDA installation
```

```

Upgrade again and reboot
```
sudo apt-get --assume-yes dist-upgrade
sudo reboot
```

#### CuDNN 6

Download the CuDNN [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) to your local machine and copy the zip file to the server (assume the ssh is configured correctly for _tf_):
```sh
scp cudnn-8.0-linux-x64-v6.0.tgz ubuntu@tf:~
```
In the spot instance:
```
cd
tar -xzf cudnn-8.0-linux-x64-v6.0.tgz
cd cuda
sudo cp lib64/* /usr/local/cuda/lib64/
sudo cp include/* /usr/local/cuda/include/
```

To speed up the performance:
```
sudo nvidia-smi -pm 1     # Configure the GPU setting to be persistent
sudo nvidia-smi --auto-boost-default=0 # Disable autoboost
sudo nvidia-smi -ac 2505,875           # Set GPU clock speed to the highest
```

Verify the installation again:
```
nvidia-smi   
```

### Anaconda3

We are installing Anaconda3 for the datascience libraries.
```sh
cd
wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-4.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh -b
cat >> ~/.bashrc << 'EOF'
export PATH=$HOME/anaconda3/bin:${PATH}
EOF
source .bashrc

conda upgrade -y --all
```

> Note, we are running in Python 3.

Create a new env. _tf_ and we activate it.
```
conda create --name tf
source activate tf
```

Note, whenever we logout from a session, we need to set the env again.
```
source activate tf
```

> It is important to **source activate tf** to the correct environment before running the TensorFlow app.
 
All and the current env. can be found by:
```
(tf) $ conda info --envs
# conda environments:
#
tf                    *  /home/ubuntu/anaconda3/envs/tf
root                     /home/ubuntu/anaconda3
```

To end the session if we are done:
```
source deactivate
```

### Install TensorFlow

```sh
source activate tf  # if we are not in tf env.
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```

Run the TensorFlow application. (This will take a few minutes to first download the dataset.)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git
python tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/fully_connected_feed.py
```

### Build TensorFlow

As shown below, the official TensorFlow release was built with generic settings but not with the optimized settings for your computer.
```
The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE4.1 instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE4.2 instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use AVX instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use AVX2 instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use FMA instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations.
```

>  However, in our GAN application, we do not see significant performance improvement. (Details later) 

Here, we are building TensorFlow manually. Checkout TensorFlow if not done already. (This is done in previous steps. )

### Create a new AMI

We can use the new instance to create a new AMI to built a new instance without going through the previous steps.

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/tensorflow/cs.png" style="border:none;width:80%">
</div>

Once a new instance is created with the new AMI, we need to
```sh
sudo nvidia-smi -pm 1     # Configure the GPU setting to be persistent
sudo nvidia-smi --auto-boost-default=0 # Disable autoboost
sudo nvidia-smi -ac 2505,875           # Set GPU clock speed to the highest
```

This AMI is available publicly as ami-5db19338 on us-east-2 region (Ohio).

### Attach a EBS for permanent data

In the AWS console, we create a new volume under the elastic block store.

<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/tensorflow/esb1.png" style="border:none;width:70%">
</div>

Then we attached the EBS to our instance.
<div class="imgcap">
<img src="/assets/tensorflow/esb2.png" style="border:none;width:80%">
</div>

Login to the instance and verify the new EBS is available.
```
$ lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0  30G  0 disk
└─xvda1 202:1    0  30G  0 part /
xvdf    202:80   0  20G  0 disk
```

> Our new drive is called xvdf above.

Check if it is empty. (If the output is "/dev/xvdf: data", it is empty. )
```
$ sudo file -s /dev/xvdf
/dev/xvdf: data
```


Format the drive **if it is empty**. WARNING: This will erase data on xvdf.
```
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
```

Create a new directory for your application and data. 
```sh
mkdir /home/ubuntu/gan
```
Note: If you want to have multiple applications to run in this instance, you should create a directory like "/data" instead.

Mount the drive to the new directory
```sh
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /home/ubuntu/gan
```

Change the directory ownership
```
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /home/ubuntu/gan 
```

Verify
```
$ df -h

```

To enable auto-mount on reboot, we need to locate the UUID for the new EBS.
```

### Performance comparison

No doubt, a machine with GPU runs a TensorFlow application much faster. Our TensorFlow application Generative adversary network GAN runs 25 times faster in the P2 instance than a local Mac machine. However, this is a poor comparison because our 4-year old Mac has a slower CPU. Nevertheless, the speed improvement is significant since we need to run our GAN application overnight in P2 to even show some reasonable result. Running GAN on a machine without GPU is not feasible.

Does it worth to build a custom environment rather than using the Amazon Deep Learning AMI? Amazon deep learning AMI creates an environment in minutes with all the important packages. But it charges extra per hour for the software. To build our own custom system, we can use the latest version of CUDA, CuDNN and Python libraries. But un-expected issues will often pop up that will take time to resolve. The first built may take hours to finish. But once an AMI is built, there are not much difference to create a new instance. Does it worth it to rebuilt the TensorFlow code with the CPU optimization for the computer? Our GAN application uses CNN. ReLU, fully connected network heavily. From end to end, we see no speed improvement. We suspect most important tasks are done in the GPU which the CPU optimization does not make an impact. Nevertheless, we do realize the variable initialization and checkpoint saving is much faster in our custom build. But it is not frequent enough to make a difference. It is still in-conclusive on whether a custom TensorFlow build is faster. In our situration, it is not significant for our GAN application.
